The set by The Odin Project is to create a 16 x 16 grid of squares that change colour when the user hovers over them.

the grid should be create using JavaScript and not HTML.

The grid shouldn't use grid, but flexbox instead as the course hasn't covered grid yet and further practice with flexbox will be beneficial.
